Smart Planning of EV Charging Stations with Machine Learning Algorithms

Substantial environmental problems are being brought on by rising pollution levels, which is why more is being done to address this urgent problem. Reducing pollution from combustion engine vehicles has been a major concern, which has resulted in significant expenditures in hybrid and electric vehicle (EV) battery research and development. Advances in electric vehicle (EV) technology have the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry by lowering greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing sustainability.
By precisely forecasting the power demand at charging stations and determining the ideal operating parameters, this study benefits the EV sector. In order to increase consumer engagement and operational efficiency, we suggest a changed business process that makes use of digital technology. Our research tackles important issues in EV infrastructure, such as the best power needs for charging stations and service feature shortcomings, by incorporating machine learning (ML) approaches.
There are management and technological ramifications to the suggested structure. It highlights the necessity of systems that can quickly receive, store, and analyse vast amounts of data while adjusting to external variables like the availability of EVs and the integration of renewable energy. This work demonstrates the encouraging potential of machine learning (ML)-based decision support systems to address the fluctuating power requirements of electric vehicles and promote environmentally friendly transportation options, notwithstanding current obstacles.
